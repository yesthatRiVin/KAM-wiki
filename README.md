# KAT Advanced Medical Wiki
  
This is the Wiki for the KAT Advanced Medical mod. As this wiki is still a MASSIVE work in progress, this readme will remain a hot mess (much like it's author).

This Wiki will (for now) only cover information contained within the production version of the KAM mod. This won't cover anything regarding ACE medical, or features in the dev version of KAM.
